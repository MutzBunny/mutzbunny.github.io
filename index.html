				<h3>Hey &lt;3</h3>
				<h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
				<!-- Navigation bar placeholder -->
				<h2>About me:</h2>
				<div class="section">
					I am Mutz.<br>
					A huge nerd and I have a hoarding/collecting problem. I study Electronic Music Production, but apart from that, I really like to mess around with vintage electronics, computers and mechanical stuff.<br>
					I am interested in everything techy, from 1960s huge supercomputers that have the calculation power of a modern calculator to modern technologies like raytracing.<br>
					Not only that, I can get fascinated by cars, trains, elevators, space, rockets, satellites, and so much more. I have autism and ADHD, and so have sometimes some difficulties expressing myself or staying focused.
				</div>
				<h2>What? Who? Why?</h2>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

							<h3>Why This Page?</h3>
							<div class="section">
								I created this page because I wanted to have an outlet to share my projects. I have so many things that I want to do, that I am doing and that I have done. I enjoy sharing my progress a lot and always get so excited when people appreciate what I do. It makes my ADHD the happiest ADHD on earth.

				<h3>Projects?</h3>
				<div class="section">
					Many of my projects are very involved and often way above my capabilities. I then slowly work my way to completing it.<br>
					(Or alternatively get overwhelmed and completely abandon the project, but we don't talk about that. Shush~)<br>
					Ideas, progress and stuff will be regularly posted on the blog, and if stuff gets serious, I do document it in the documentation corner of this page. I also have a place where I archive stuff. I have many weird and rare computers of the was-ago age of time, and I would like to preserve this kind of stuff here. I will upload all kinds of stuff I can find and archive it here.<br>
					Additionally, I might sometimes update you guys on my mental health here, because I am still not mentally doing too well.
				</div>
				<h2>What I do:</h2>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td width="33%" valign="top">
							<h4>Blogging</h4>
							<div class="section">
								Project status, progress, random shower thoughts, ideas and mental health status updates all go there. I try to post regularly and keep interesting stuff there.<br><br>
								<a href="/blog"><b>To the blog</b></a>
							</div>
						</td>
						<td width="33%" valign="top">
							<h4>Documenting</h4>
							<div class="section">
								When I work on my project I want to document my work as good as possible. I think easy to understand documentation is important and in the hopes to make my projects as accessible as possible you will find all the documentation there.<br><br>
								<a href="/libary"><b>To the Documentation library</b></a>
							</div>
						</td>
						<td width="33%" valign="top">
							<h4>Archiving</h4>
							<div class="section">
								From ROM dumps over scans of circuit boards to scans of manuals. I try to archive as much as I can to preserve it from disappearing. The Internet Archive is a good place to start, but here you will find specifically what I have.<br><br>

				<h2>Why Analogic?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					It's a longer story, but generally back a long time ago, I wanted to have my own website and I came up with this domain. It should represent a wordplay of combining Analog and Logic. But also the furry inside me wanted a funny butt joke, so I made it in a way that the first 4 letters spell a butt joke... I know I am very mature how did you know?<br>
					Anyway, if you are interested what I do apart from this page, I can give you all the links to places:

				<h2>About me:</h2>
				<div class="section">
					I am Mutz, also known as Toby, born in 2003 with a heavy case of Autism called Asperger syndrome. Furthermore I also have ADHD and bipolar disorder. If that sounds like a lot to you, it may be because it is a lot. Living with those kinds of disorders is not easy, but after more than 20 years, I started to figure out how to deal with it. My autism gave me the amazing trait, that I can get obsessively interested into a topic and invest a lot of time and effort into learning about it. This led to me having very strong and specific interests, and ultimately why this page exists. If you, a family member or a friend of you have problems mentally or are having trouble with Asperger, you can shoot me an email. I am no therapist or expert, but I might be able to give some advice from experience, and I am always willing to help.<br><br>
					Also, I am a furry. If you don't know what a furry is, that's fine, you did not miss anything.<br>
					If you do know what a furry is and are upset about it now, well I kindly ask you to leave, because a random stranger on the internet won't change my opinion anyway, so save yourself the effort of trying &lt;3<br>
					Take care, love you all &lt;3
